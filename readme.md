# Minicloud

> Minicloud is a small Minecraft cloud system that allows you to run Minecraft servers easily.

## Features

- Easy to use **(WIP)**
- Fast: We use Golang for the backend with Gate as the proxy.
- Secure: All servers are isolated with Docker.
- Scalable: You can run as many servers as you want.
